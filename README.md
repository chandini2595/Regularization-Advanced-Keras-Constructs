# üß† Deep Learning: Regularization & Advanced Keras Constructs

This repository contains two major components of deep learning work using TensorFlow and Keras:

- **Part 1**: Data Augmentation & Generalization Techniques  
- **Part 2**: Advanced Keras Customization Techniques

Each section includes Google Colab notebooks and a comprehensive video walkthrough that explains the code, shows execution, and breaks down concepts in detail.
